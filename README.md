Code in this repository generates an [interactive map](http://wtadler.com/gov_map.html) to visualize the Democratic governor's race. It uses the following data, which is copied into the repository:
- unofficial precinct-level results from the 9/13/2018 primaries in NYC, [as I scraped them for OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny/tree/master/2018/unofficial)
- NYC shapefiles posted at [nvkelso/election-geodata](https://github.com/nvkelso/election-geodata/tree/master/data/36-new-york/061-new-york/2017)

[nyc_map.py](nyc_map.py) can be modified to generate visualizations of any other race that happened on 9/13.
