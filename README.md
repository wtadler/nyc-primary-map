Code in this repository combines the unofficial precinct-level results from the 9/13/2018 primaries in NYC, [as I scraped them for OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny/tree/master/2018/unofficial) with the NYC shapefiles posted at [nvkelso/election-geodata](https://github.com/nvkelso/election-geodata/tree/master/data/36-new-york/061-new-york/2017), to visualize the Democratic governor's race.

[nyc_map.py](nyc_map.py) can be modified to generate visualizations of any other race that happened on 9/13.
